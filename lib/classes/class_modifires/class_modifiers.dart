! Class Modiers
class modifiers are nothing but its just a keyword that can be used
to specify the certain behavior or characteristics of the class
just lke when we use List<String> so now the list must have strings
just like that there are some of the class modifiers keywords that can be use
before the class so that the class will work just like that 
like there is abstract class. so abstract is also a class modifier
we use it before when we creating a abstract class.
